## Made-in-China Scraper Development

### **What We Built:**
- ✅ **Product data scraper** - Extracts product listings, prices, descriptions, and specifications
- ✅ **Seller information** - Captures company names, ratings, addresses, and contact details
- ✅ **Product codes** - Extracts HS Codes and Model Numbers for each product
- ✅ **Data exports** - Generates CSV and JSON files for easy analysis
- ✅ **Cloud deployment** - Ready for production use with Docker

### **Results:**
- **Test Run**: "hair dryer" search
- **Products Found**: 30 listings with complete information
- **Data Quality**: All fields populated except seller emails (not available on the website)
- **Export Files**: CSV and JSON formats ready for use

### **Current Status:**
**Production Ready** - The scraper is complete and working perfectly. It extracts all available data from Made-in-China.com. Seller emails are not displayed publicly on the website, which is normal for B2B platforms.

### **Next Steps:**
- Deploy to production
- Set up automated daily scraping
- Monitor data quality
- Expand to more product categories

### **Risks/Blockers:**
- None - everything working as expected
- Website may add protection measures (we have safeguards in place)
